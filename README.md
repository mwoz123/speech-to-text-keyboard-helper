# Speech To Text Keyboard Helper

**Note:** This plugin does NOT provide speech to text service

As Google Speech to Text Android keyboard does not handle _new line_ command, this plugin makes available such commands via Obsidian command pallete (and from there could be added to mobile buttons toolbar).

Currently supported commands:
- append new line (and jump to it)
- prepend new line (and jump to it)
